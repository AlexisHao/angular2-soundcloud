Sound Cloud Music player made by Angular2

## Introduction
The best way of learning is doing something. So this music player is made so I can learn better about Angular 2. When
 making this app. I learn a lot of new structure of Angular 2, dependency injection and Typescript. Angular 2 is great, their component structure make
 it easy to create webapp then ever. With Angular 2, we can forget about controller, $scope, module and many complicated concepts in AngularJS. Right now we can
 focus on create a well maintain and better performance app.

Typescript is a great tool too. If you already know C# then you can fall in love with Typescript. With Typescript we can create class, interface and we take advantage of autocomplete in text editor.
My favorite text editor is VS Code which is fully support for Typescript.
